# Nand2Tetris Project

## About Nand2Tetris

Nand2Tetris, also known as "The Elements of Computing Systems," is a comprehensive course that guides students through the process of building a modern computer system from the ground up. Starting with basic logic gates, participants progressively construct a functional computer, including both hardware and software components.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into two main parts:
1. Hardware: Building the computer's architecture
2. Software: Developing the software hierarchy

## Key Benefits

By completing this course, I have gained:

1. **Comprehensive Understanding:** A deep insight into computer architecture and how different components interact.
2. **Practical Experience:** Hands-on practice in both hardware design and software development.
3. **Abstraction Mastery:** Experience working with various levels of abstraction in computing.
4. **Enhanced Problem-Solving:** Improved ability to approach complex systems and break them down into manageable components.
5. **Solid Foundation:** A strong base for exploring advanced topics in computer science.

## Project Structure
The complete Nand to Tetris experience spans 12 projects. Each project consists of project guidelines and lecture slides. Some projects link to chapters from the book's 1st edition:

1. Project 1: Boolean Logic
2. Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
3. Project 3: Memory
4. Project 4: Machine Language
5. Project 5: Computer Architecture
6. Project 6: Assembler
7. Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic
8. Project 8: VM II: Program Control
9. Project 9: High-Level Language
10. Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
11. Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
12. Project 12: Operating System
