# Word Guess Game Development Plan

## Setup and Basic Structure

1. Set up Jack development environment
2. Create main game class structure
3. Implement word selection mechanism
   - Create a small list of words
   - Develop function to randomly select a word

4. Develop basic user interface
   - Implement functions for displaying game state
   - Create input mechanism for letter guesses

## Core Game Logic

1. Implement guess checking mechanism
   - Function to check if a letter is in the word
   - Update display based on correct guesses

2. Develop game flow control
   - Implement main game loop
   - Add win/lose conditions
3. Basic error handling
   - Handle invalid inputs
   - Prevent repeated guesses

## Refinement and Extra Features

1. Refine user interface
   - Improve game state display
   - Add instructions for the player

2. Implement optional features (time permitting)
   - Score tracking
   - Multiple difficulty levels
   - Option to play again
3. Testing and debugging
4. Documentation

## Optional Enhancements (if time allows)
- Expand word list
- Add hints feature
- Implement basic graphics using Jack's capabilities
